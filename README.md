# 🧠 Blockchain Development Eviction Test

Welcome to your **Eviction Test**!  
This assessment will test your understanding of **smart contract development**, **testing**, and **deployment** using **Foundry** and **Hardhat**.

You are required to complete **two (2) tasks** before the stated deadline.

---

## 🚀 Task 1: Web3 Uni – Staking Contract (Foundry)

### 🏛 Scenario
Imagine a decentralized university called **Web3 Uni**, which rewards its students for their dedication.  
The university has its own ERC20 token — **StudyToken (STUDY)**.

To encourage long-term learning, Web3 Uni wants a **staking smart contract** that allows students to lock up (“stake”) their STUDY tokens for a fixed period.  
In return, they earn rewards for their commitment.

### ✅ Requirements
- Build the staking contract using **Foundry**.  
- The contract should:
  - Allow users to **stake** and **unstake** STUDY tokens.
  - Include **reward calculation** logic.
  - Ensure staking happens for a **fixed period**.
- Write **sufficient test cases** (at least **50% test coverage or higher**).
- Ensure all tests **run successfully** using Foundry.

## 🏦 Task 2: Simple Bank Smart Contract (Hardhat)

### ✅ Requirements
- Write a **simple bank smart contract** using **Hardhat**.
- The contract must include **at least four (4) functions**, such as:
  - `deposit()`
  - `withdraw()`
  - `checkBalance()`
  - `transfer()`
- Write **unit tests** for all functions.
- Take a **screenshot** showing all **passing tests**.
- **Deploy** the contract to the **Base Sepolia testnet**.
- Submit your **deployed contract address** along with your test screenshot.

---

## 🕒 Submission Deadline
📅 **Friday – 11:59 PM**

---

## 📤 What to Submit
- **Task 1:** Foundry project folder (including tests).  
- **Task 2:** Hardhat project folder, screenshot of passing tests, and deployed contract address.  
- Optionally, include a short `README.md` inside each project describing your approach and setup.
